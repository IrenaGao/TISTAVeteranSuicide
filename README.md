# Instructions
Create a virtual environment and install tensorflow and scikit-learn, which are modules essential to running app.py. There are a couple of other modules you'll have to install as well. Usually, you can run "pip install tensorflow," for example. To run the app, type ```python python app.py``` in terminal.

Make sure you add the model_weights.h5 file from the Google Drive into the base folder!
